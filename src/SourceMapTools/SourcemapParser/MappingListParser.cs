			 *  The fields in each segment are:

			 *     If this is the first field of the first segment, or the first segment following a new generated line(“;”), 
			 *     then this field holds the whole base 64 VLQ.Otherwise, this field contains a base 64 VLQ that is relative to
			 *     the previous occurrence of this field.Note that this is different than the fields below because the previous 
			 *     value is reset after every generated line.
			 *  2. If present, an zero - based index into the “sources” list.This field is a base 64 VLQ relative to the previous
			 *     occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value is represented.
			 *  3. If present, the zero-based starting line in the original source represented. This field is a base 64 VLQ relative to the
			 *     previous occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value is 
			 *     represented.Always present if there is a source field.
			 *  4. If present, the zero - based starting column of the line in the source represented.This field is a base 64 VLQ relative to 
			 *     the previous occurrence of this field, unless this is the first occurrence of this field, in which case the whole value is
			 *     represented.Always present if there is a source field.
			 *  5. If present, the zero - based index into the “names” list associated with this segment.This field is a base 64 VLQ relative
